### Introduction
In this article I will introduce the fundamental quantitative concepts behind poker strategy.   
Without understanding these concepts, your chances of ever becoming a profitable player in  
even a mildly tough game will be very low. Thus, it is important that you make sure you grasp  
these concepts at a theoretical level.

### Hand Combinatorics and Ranges
There are three categories of hands:  
* Suited holdings eg. KQs AKs  
* Unsuited Holdings: KQo, AKo  
* Pocket Pairs: 66, 77  
  
#### Pocket Pair Combinatorics
Pocket pairs have six combos. So for the holding '66' there would be be:  
* 6 hearts 6 diamonds
* 6 hearts 6 spades
* 6 hearts 6 clubs
* 6 diamonds 6 clubs
* 6 diamonds 6 spades
* 6 spades 6 clubs 
   
Removing just one 6 from the deck takes the amount of possible combos to 3.
Removing another 6 from the deck brings the possible combos of 6 down to one.
(Check for yourself by trying to exclude a suit and see how many are left.
