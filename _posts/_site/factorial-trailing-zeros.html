<h2 id="legendres-formula">Legendre’s Formula</h2>

<p>There is a theorem in number theory known as <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Legendre%27s_Formula"><em>Legendre’s Formula</em></a>. It states that if N is a positive integer and p is a prime number, then the highest power of p that divides N! is given by the following formula</p>

\[e_{p} = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\lfloor{\frac{N}{p^{i}}}\rfloor\]

<p>Translating math to english this reads “The highest power of p that divides N! is the infinite sum of the floor of N divided by p to the current exponent”</p>

<p>We know that the infinite sum will eventually reach a terminal value of 0 as at some point, we will reach a large enough exponent for p that the result of dividing n by p raised to i is less than 1. And taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">floor</a> of any value less than 1 will give us 0. Therefore, we do not need to worry about adding up an infinite amount of quotients unless our N is astronomically large.</p>

<h3 id="adaptation-for-trailing-zeros">Adaptation For Trailing Zeros</h3>

<p>This formula will allow us to determine the highest power of p in N!. But what about non-prime values? We can take the prime factorization of our target number and run separate instances of the function. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we can simply take the minimum value returned by running the formula on 2, and then 5.</p>

\[\min(\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\lfloor{\frac{N}{2^{i}}}\rfloor,\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\lfloor{\frac{N}{5^{i}}}\rfloor)\]

<p>But, knowing that powers of 5 will always be larger than powers of two, the number returned by Legendre’s formula for 5 will always be smaller. Therefore, we can dispense with the minimum function altogether and simply find out how many exponents of 5 divide into the factorial. This will give us the number of trailing zeros.</p>

<h4 id="trailing-zeros-in-100">Trailing zeros in 100!</h4>

\[\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\lfloor{\frac{100}{5^{i}}}\rfloor) = \lfloor\frac{100}{5}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{100}{5^{2}}\rfloor = 20 +4 = 24\]

<p>We have 24 trailing zeros in 100!</p>

<h4 id="trailing-zeros-in-95">Trailing zeros in 95!</h4>

\[\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\lfloor{\frac{95}{5^{i}}}\rfloor) = \lfloor\frac{95}{5}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{95}{5^{2}}\rfloor = 19 + 3 = 22\]

<p>We have 22 traling zeros in 95!</p>

<h2 id="trailing-zeros-coding-question">Trailing Zeros Coding Question</h2>

<p>Suppose we want to write a program to find the number of trailing zeros in n!. We can simply translate our algorithm into code. We will use a while loop to iterate until the floor of our number divided by 5 to our current exponent yields zero. While iterating we will track the sum and return it upon termination.
