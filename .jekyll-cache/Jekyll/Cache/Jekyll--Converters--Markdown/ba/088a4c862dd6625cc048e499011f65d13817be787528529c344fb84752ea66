<p>In this article I will introduce the fundamental quantitative concepts behind poker strategy.
Without understanding these concepts, your chances of ever becoming a profitable player in
even a mildly tough game will be very low. Thus, it is important that you make sure you grasp
these concepts at a theoretical level.</p>

<h3 id="hand-combinatorics-and-ranges">Hand Combinatorics and Ranges</h3>
<p>There are three categories of hands:<br />
	* Suited holdings eg. KQs AKs<br />
	* Unsuited Holdings: KQo, AKo<br />
	* Pocket Pairs: 66, 77</p>

<h4 id="pocket-pair-combinatorics">Pocket Pair Combinatorics</h4>
<p>Pocket pairs have six combos. So for the holding â€˜66â€™ there would be be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>6 hearts 6 diamonds</li>
  <li>6 hearts 6 spades</li>
  <li>6 hearts 6 clubs</li>
  <li>6 diamonds 6 clubs</li>
  <li>6 diamonds 6 spades</li>
  <li>6 spades 6 clubs<br />
Removing just one â€˜6â€™ card</li>
</ul>
