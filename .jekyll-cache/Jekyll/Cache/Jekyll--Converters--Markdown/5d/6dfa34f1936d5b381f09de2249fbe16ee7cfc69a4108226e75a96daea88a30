I"ú<p>Today we will discuss a famous problem known as the St. Petersburg Paradox. The problem was originally presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli">Daniel Bernoulli</a> in 1738 in the Commentaries of the Imperial Academy of Science of Saint Petersburg (hence the name).
