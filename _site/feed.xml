				<title>The St. Petersburg Paradox, When EV Isn't Enough</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we will discuss a famous problem known as the St. Petersburg Paradox. The problem was originally presented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli&quot;&gt;Daniel Bernoulli&lt;/a&gt; in 1738 in the Commentaries of the Imperial Academy of Science of Saint Petersburg (hence the name). The problem demonstrates that certain games may have extremely high payoff/utility yet the variance of outcomes can be such that no sensible person would participate (despite extremely high expectation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are paying a fixed fee to participate in a coin tossing game. Assume that the coin is evenly weighted (fair). The coin will be tossed repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a cash prize that starts at 1$. Every time the coin lands heads, the size of the pot doubles. Once the coin lands of tails, the game ends and you win whatever is contained in the pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much should you pay to play this game in order to break even?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expected-value-of-the-game&quot;&gt;Expected Value of The Game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well from basic decision theory we know that a break-even decision is one where the cost is equal to the utility of a decision. Therefore, in order to calculate the break-even price, we simply need to calculate the expected value of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the probability of flipping n heads consecutively is&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{1}{2^n}\]

&lt;p&gt;Since we win $1 if the first flip is tails (0 heads), the payoff on the nth consecutive head is&lt;/p&gt;

\[2^{n -1}\]

&lt;p&gt;So for a single value of n, where n is the number of consecutive heads we get in a single session of the game, the expectation would be&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{1}{2^n} * 2^{n -1}\]

&lt;p&gt;​	Are we done? NO! A single value of n only measures one branch of the game tree. But there are an infinite number of branches on the game tree. The higher n is, the lower the probability of that specific outcome on the game tree, yet there is an outcome for every possible branch. Therefore, the entire expectation can be represented by an infinite sum.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} * 2^{n -1} = \infty\]

&lt;p&gt;We can see that the infinite sum converges to infinity! Don’t believe me? Let’s step through the sum for each value of n.&lt;/p&gt;

\[E[\infty] = (\frac{1}{2} * 1) + (\frac{1}{4} * 2) + (\frac{1}{8} * 4)...\]

&lt;p&gt;We can see that if we continue we will get an infinite sum of 1/2’s. Therefore, the expectation of the game is infinity! So hypothetically, the break-even price to lay this game is also infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wheres-the-paradox&quot;&gt;Where’s The Paradox?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox is that despite the game having such a high payoff, nobody with common sense would pay more than a few dollars to play the game. This is because the branches of the game tree with high payoffs are extremely hard to reach, yet since the utility of those branches grow at a similar rate, the expectation does not diminish for lower probability events as it would in most games.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The ONLY Poker Books Worth Reading</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the trickiest parts about improving as a Poker player is finding high quality learning resources. There are numerous successful players over the years who have written books on their approaches to the game, yet Poker evolves so quickly that these books are often outdated within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time playing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.encorebostonharbor.com/&quot;&gt;Encore in Boston&lt;/a&gt;, I came across many older gentleman who were poker book junkies. They had read dozens of strategy books yet still struggled to beat relatively easy live games. This is because poker books that actually give quality information are very rare. Additionally, these books are extremely technical and often scare away the mathematically illiterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will review the few and only books I would ever recommend reading if you want to become a winning player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modern-poker-theory-by-michael-acevedo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Poker-Theory-unbeatable-principles/dp/1909457892&quot;&gt;Modern Poker Theory&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Acevedo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely cannot say enough good things about this book. It is a culmination of the best parts of every poker book I’ve ever read and it’s backed by rigorous research in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.piosolver.com/&quot;&gt;PioSolver&lt;/a&gt;. The author has experienced significant success on the tournament circuit both live and online and has a background as a financial analyst and mathematician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book bridges theoretical analysis with a grounding in practical hand examples without becoming just another hand review book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is primarily geared towards MTT’s and will be most useful if you are used to playing poker at shorter stack depths. As a cash game player, I still found this book extremely useful as he approaches the game from a formal context grounded in Game Theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will learn the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fundamental game theory concepts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to classify ranges as condensed, polarized, capped/uncapped based on various situations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The relationship between range polarization and bet size&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to classify various hands into equity buckets and build a strategy for all your holdings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to analyze complex data and outputs from solvers in order to execute GTO lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that this book alone won’t leave you walking away as a significantly better player, but it will give you the background knowledge to approach the game like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applications-of-no-limit-holdem-by-matthew-janda&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Applications-No-Limit-Hold-Matthew-Janda/dp/1880685558/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=applications+of+no+limit+holdem&amp;amp;qid=1605807752&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Applications of No Limit Hold’em&lt;/a&gt; by Matthew Janda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications of No-limit Holdem is considered a classic and is an essential read for anyone seeking to become a competent player. I consider myself extraordinarily lucky to have read this book early on in my poker journey. It is worth noting that while this book has aged extraordinarily well, there are a few aspects of it that are outdated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preflop Ranges: The original preflop ranges in this book were constructed based on frequencies and manual calculations. In the age of solvers, you are better off using ranges constructed from sims.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hand Reviews Chapter: I would recommend skipping the hand reviews chapter at the end of the book since modern solvers have revealed flaws in Matthew’s range construction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book formed the back-bone of Doug Polk’s strategy and guided much of his analysis. Doug Polk at the height of his career was considered the very best heads up no limit player in the world after beating Ben Sulsky. If you plan on going through this book I would recommend a slow read and to carefully work through all the equations and examples. This will result in a strong foundational knowledge of poker theory which you will be able to build on very rapidly. Applications of No Limit Hold’em can be a daunting read and is theoretically intensive but is absolutely necessary to developing a background in GTO play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expert-heads-up-no-limit-holdem-by-will-tipton&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Heads-Limit-Holdem-Exploitative/dp/1904468942/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=expert+heads+up+no+limit+hold%27em&amp;amp;qid=1605809356&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Expert Heads Up No Limit Hold’em&lt;/a&gt; by Will Tipton&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Tipton has become sort of a cult icon in the Poker Theory community. He was the very first person to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.piosolver.com/blogs/news/62725637-choosing-a-subset-of-flops-to-represent-the-whole-game&quot;&gt;weighted flop subset representation&lt;/a&gt; of the game and even released a package of &lt;a href=&quot;https://husng.com/content/will-tipton-video-pack-0&quot;&gt;video tutorials&lt;/a&gt; with his book that walk through analyzing toy games in &lt;a href=&quot;gambit-project.org/&quot;&gt;Gambit&lt;/a&gt;. Many concepts in the book were completely foreign to most players in the community back in 2012. Additionally, Tipton brings the advantage of his background in theoretical computer science which allows him to rigorously formalize his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite lessons from the book are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thinking of expected value in terms of the overall game tree&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proper definition of maximally exploitative strategies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How iterative exploitation leads to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium&quot;&gt;nash equilibria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How turn and river runouts influence equity distributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Range distributions on various board structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the title of this book is misleading. This book is extremely useful for ALL poker players, not just heads up players. Although, this is the style Will is most known for specializing in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expert-heads-up-no-limit-holdem-volume-2-by-will-tipton&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Heads-Limit-Holdem-Play/dp/1909457035/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3MW6AB8TPNCVS&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=expert+heads+up+no+limit+hold%27em&amp;amp;qid=1605810277&amp;amp;sprefix=expert+heads+up+no+limi%2Caps%2C164&amp;amp;sr=8-3&quot;&gt;Expert Heads Up No Limit Hold’em Volume 2&lt;/a&gt; by Will Tipton&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert heads up No Limit Hold’em is slightly more practical than the first book as it applies his earlier ideas to multi-street situations. This is a welcome contrast to the first volume which focuses primarily on preflop play and turn/river scenarios. The book brings more nebulous concepts down to earth. As a Computer Scientist, I enjoyed this book simply for its mathematical elegance however, I still believe the concepts will hold value for many players. The book also comes with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dandbpoker.com/video/experthunlhe&quot;&gt;video pack&lt;/a&gt; where Tipton walks you through building your own poker game tree solver in Python!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-limit-holdem-for-advanced-players-emphasis-on-tough-games-by-matthew-janda&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/No-Limit-Hold-em-Advanced-Players/dp/1880685590/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=no+limit+holdem+for+advanced+players&amp;amp;qid=1605811195&amp;amp;sr=8-3&quot;&gt;No Limit Hold’em For Advanced Players: Emphasis on Tough Games&lt;/a&gt; by Matthew Janda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the books on GTO poker, this is likely the most practical. Matthew walks through an array of common spots in the game and explains reasonable lines to take based on analysis in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pokersnowie.com/&quot;&gt;Poker Snowie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.piosolver.com/&quot;&gt;PioSolver&lt;/a&gt;. This book is good for developing overall heuristics for executing GTO strategies at the table. I do not however, think the heuristics are so detailed or advanced that they will necessarily prepare you to beat tough games. That being said, the value in this book is that it is a much easier read than the others and is good for getting your feet wet in GTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-grinders-manual-by-peter-clarke&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Grinders-Manual-Complete-Course-Online-ebook/dp/B01GBFF890&quot;&gt;The Grinder’s Manual&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Clarke&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is not a theoretically focused book but rather a very pragmatic book on heuristics for executing somewhat solid lines at the table. The strength of this book is that it’s focused on 6-max cash games and includes some very useful models and approaches for determining which spots are good to C-bet and how to think through ranges. Additionally the book does a good job of explaining the advantages of being in position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is by far the most beginner friendly book on this list and will lay a great foundation to becoming a winning player. Additionally, the book does an excellent job of covering various HUD stats for effective exploitation of player pool tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mathematics-of-poker-by-bill-chen-and-jerrod-ankenman&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Poker-Bill-Chen/dp/1886070253/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-nc-drs1_0?cv_ct_cx=mathematics+of+poker&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=mathematics+of+poker&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=1886070253&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=d2ac7e2c-691a-4541-bcf7-9d34f317d170&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=cNto7&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=n10De&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=84ce0865-d9ca-42e3-87ed-168be8f93162&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=NC2KGXFY5KM339ZKVZ8R&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;qid=1605811698&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sr=1-1-88388c6d-14b8-4f70-90f6-05ac39e80cc0&quot;&gt;Mathematics of Poker&lt;/a&gt; by Bill Chen and Jerrod Ankenman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the books on this list, you would be better of reading this last. It’s not that the book itself isn’t brilliant, but rather that the math in the book is so difficult and complex for anyone without a few semesters of university math behind them that it isn’t worth reading for most players. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommended it to many of my friends. Many of them reported not being able to make it through the first few chapters. If you have taken Calculus, Probability and Statistics and perhaps a Game Theory course, you’ll get through the book just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is extremely abstracted and generally not applicable to decisions at the table but is an amazing read for those who are fans of mathematics and poker.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Poker Theory Fundamentals</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In this article I will lay out the foundational knowledge required to begin learning modern GTO (Game Theory Optimal) poker. At this point, the GTO vs Exploitative debate has essentially been settled and most reasonable people have acknowledged that if you want to be a profitable poker player you need to have a solid understanding of theory. Any exploitation should generally occur as a deliberate deviation from what you understand to be a theoretically correct play. But, if you do not have a foundational understanding of what theoretically correct play even is, your exploitative plays will be based on accurate hunches (at best) and complete delusion (at worst).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mathematical-foundations&quot;&gt;Mathematical Foundations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the foundations of GTO we will cover some very basic poker math. These concepts have been discussed ad nauseam in a variety of poker books but are still wroth being briefly mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hand-combinatorics&quot;&gt;Hand Combinatorics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three categories of hands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suited holdings
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;4 combos per holding&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;eg. AKs - 4 combos, one of spades, clubs, diamonds, hearts&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unsuited Holdings
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;12 combos per holding&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;eg. AKo - 12 combos&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pocket Pairs
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;6 combos per holding&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;eg. 66 - 6 combos&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pocket-pair-combinatorics&quot;&gt;Pocket Pair Combinatorics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pocket pairs&lt;/strong&gt; have six combos. So for the holding ‘66’ there would be be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 hearts 6 diamonds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 hearts 6 spades&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 hearts 6 clubs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 diamonds 6 clubs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 diamonds 6 spades&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 spades 6 clubs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing just one 6 from the deck takes the amount of possible combos to 3.
Removing another 6 from the deck brings the possible combos of 6 down to one.
(Check for yourself by trying to exclude a suit and see how many are left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suited holdings&lt;/strong&gt; have 4 combos. Let’s say we have AKs, removing the ace of hearts would take the number of combos down to 3. Removing  the king of hearts would have no effect since the AhKh combo has already been removed. Thus, the number of a suited combos in an opponent’s range is easy to calculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off-suit Holdings&lt;/strong&gt; have 12 combos. The removal factor on off-suit holdings is slightly more nuanced. Take the example of AKo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AKo - 12 combos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Ace is mapped to exactly three king cards (every suit of king other than it’s own suit). Likewise, each King is mapped to exactly three Ace cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removing an Ace from the deck will make the possible number of AKo combos 9. Removing an King subsequently will take the number of combos down to 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outs-and-equity&quot;&gt;Outs and Equity:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of outs a hand has is simply the number of possible cards left in the deck that can result in a player making a draw of a pair etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common mental math calculation is to multiply the number of outs by 4 on the flop for the probability of making a hand such as a flop or a straight by the river and to multiply by 2 on the turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Hand Type&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Outs&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Flush Draw&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Open Ended Straight Draw&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Gut-shot Straight draw&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pot-odds&quot;&gt;Pot Odds:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an opponent bets, pot odds can be calculated as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{bet}{pot + bet}\]

&lt;p&gt;This will give you the frequency at which you would need to call to theoretically keep your opponent indifferent to bluffing you with any two cards (more on this later). But as we will later discover this approach to defense in the game is heavily outdated, however for players who are vastly under or over-defending vs raises and bets, this concept can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hand-odds&quot;&gt;Hand Odds:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you the amount of equity against your opponent’s range required to defend against a bet. Again, this model is outdated and has been disproven by solvers but is still useful for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{bet}{2*bet + pot}\]

&lt;h3 id=&quot;range-morphology&quot;&gt;Range Morphology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range is a set of hands. Preflop, you have a range for each action, whether you open-raise, 3-bet or flat an open defines that range. You range will interact with flops in a variety of ways. There are a few words we use to describe ranges and their states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linear Range: A range that contains the best hands, the worst hands, and everything in-between&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Condensed Range: A range that is condensed contains mostly medium strength hands with very few if any strong and weak hands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Polarized: A polarized range contains the strong hands and weak hands but very few if any medium strength hands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capped Range: A capped range is a range that does not contain the very strongest hands on a board runout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uncapped: An uncapped range contains the best possible holdings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-game-theory-optimal-concepts&quot;&gt;Basic Game Theory Optimal Concepts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have given you a brief summary of the foundations of poker strategy we will now dive into the basics of game theory optimal play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history-of-gto-play&quot;&gt;History of GTO Play&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of an optimal strategy to poker is as old as the field of game theory itself. Von Neumann cited poker as the inspiration of his early works on game theory and wanted to formalize the strategies behind bluffing. John Nash, and Harold W. Kuhn also developed poker toy games which they solved to equilibrium in order to further develop their ideas on games of hidden information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-things-are-different-now&quot;&gt;Why Things Are Different Now&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old way of conducting game theory research was to come up with a game, formalize the rules, and attempt to calculate an equilibrium and utility payoff structure. After deeply analyzing the game tree, mathematicians could calculate optimal solutions either by hand or with some form of computational assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the technique used by Edward O. Thorpe when he first invented card counting for blackjack. Now, with very fast computers, we can simply run simulations of model poker games and observe their solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than theorizing about what might be optimal play, we can simply observe optimal play and work backwards in terms of developing heuristics to imitate software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gto-concept-1-minimum-defense-frequency&quot;&gt;GTO Concept 1: Minimum Defense Frequency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In around 2013, Matthew Janda published his widely acclaimed book “Applications of No-Limit Hold’em.” This work popularized the concept of minimum defense frequencies and formed the back-bone of success behind many successful poker players such as Doug Polk, Ryan Fee and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the concept of MDF was not anywhere close to being representative of actual GTO play. It was however, so vastly superior to whatever techniques others were using in their calling/raising strategies at the time, that it made a great many players rich beyond their wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us suppose that you are facing a bet on the river. Your hand consists of a medium strength bluff catcher, where your opponent either holds the nuts, or total air. In other words; your opponent has a ‘perfectly polarized range’ consisting of hands with either 100% equity or 0% equity at an even distribution vs your bluff catcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would be go about calculating the optimal frequency at which you need to call in order to keep villain indifferent to bluffing? In other words, how can we call in such a way that the EV of betting is effectively zero, and villain gains no additional value by bluffing?&lt;/p&gt;

\[EV[Bluffing] = 0 = (Pot)*(1 - C) - (Bet)*C\]

&lt;p&gt;When villain attempts to bluff us and we fold, he wins whatever is in the pot. When villain attempts to bluff us and we call, he loses whatever it is that he has bet.
By solving for the appropriate calling frequency we arrive at the conclusion that:&lt;/p&gt;

\[C = \frac{Pot}{Pot + Bet}\]

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that by calling at least C% of the time, we can assure that our opponent will not gain any additional utility by betting with a hand that would lose at showdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gto-concept-2-value-to-bluff-ratios&quot;&gt;GTO Concept 2: Value to Bluff Ratios&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let there be two players, an IP (in position) and an OOP (out of position) player.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let IP have a perfectly polarized range on the river (hands with either 100% equity or 0% equity) so that whenever OOP calls we effectively win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: What proportion of our river betting range should be value hands (hands that win at showdown) vs what proportion should be bluffs to make the EV of our opponent calling zero?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let X be our bluffing frequency on a river bet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let P be the original size of the pot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let B be the size of our bet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assume EV of Calling - EV of Folding = 0 (Our opponent is indifferent to either actions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EV of Folding is always zero, therefore we need to only solve EV[Call]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our opponent will win the size of the pot + our bet when he calls our bluffs and will lose the size of our bet when he calls our value bets.&lt;/p&gt;

\[EV[Call] = 0 = (P + B)x - B(1 - x)\]

&lt;p&gt;Solving for x&lt;/p&gt;

\[X = B/(P + 2B)\]

&lt;p&gt;Now using our equation we can determine the frequency at which we should be bluffing for any given bet size where B is a fraction of P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pot Sized Bet (B = P): 33% bluffs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3/4 Sized Bet (B = .75P): 30% bluffs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 Sized Bet (B = .5P): 25% bluffs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/3 Sized Bet (B = .33P): 20% bluffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s of course notice that the larger our bet-size the more bluff heavy our range is! To most players this seems counter-intuitive but let’s use some very simple reasoning to think through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an opponent calls our value bet, we win what’s already in the pot + whatever we risked. When an opponent calls our bluff, we only lose what we risked. Larger bet sizes cause a rational opponent to fold at a higher frequency meaning that we must accordingly add more bluffs.  Additionally, we can afford to lose at showdown often when we bluff since value bets will win us much larger pots. Large bet sizes are positively correlated with a more polarized range (separation between bluffs and value bets) whereas smaller bet sizes are more useful when ranges are too heavy to want to generate folds. This is evident in many solver simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
